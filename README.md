***TASK*** <br>
In this homework assignment, implement several functions for manipulating a heap. These functions are:
  - A Heapify function to create a heap from elements in a given array.
  - A DeleteRoot function to remove the largest element from the heap (i.e., the root of the heap), and then reconstruct the heap.
  - A HeapSort algorithm to sort the elements using a heap. <br>
You can implement the solution as a class. Demonstrate the functionality of the functions using sample data. The data can be directly embedded in the code; there is no need to load it from external sources. Information for solving the homework can be taken from the book [1] and the presentations related to the course.
